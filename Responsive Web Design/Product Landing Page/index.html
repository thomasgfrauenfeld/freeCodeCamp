            <section class="main-section" id="Overview">
                <p>The new 18-inch tires were designed from the ground-up, with every 
                    element of the tire drawn from a clean sheet of paper: from the 
                    profile, to the structure, to the compounds. The design process 
                    took in more than 10,000 hours of indoor testing, more than 5000 
                    hours of simulation, and more than 70 prototypes developed 
                    virtually, to eventually create 30 different specifications that 
                    were tested by nearly all the teams over more than 20,000 
                    kilometres. The role of the drivers was crucial, with each of them 
                    contributing to the development at various points and helping 
                    Pirelli arrive at the definitive specifications thanks to their 
                    feedback.</p>
                <p>The new tyres have a wider working range than their 13-inch 
                    predecessors, without compromising warm-up. As a result, overheating 
                    is limited and degradation is reduced. There are additionally new 
                    temperatures for the tyre blankets. All the tyres will now be heated 
                    up to 70 degrees, rather than 100 degrees at the front and 80 degrees 
                    at the rear, as was the case previously. The reduction of tyre blanket 
                    temperatures is part of a plan to gradually eliminate tyre blankets 
                    over the coming seasons, to help reduce electricity consumption and 
                    aid sustainability.</p>
                <p>The new 18-inch tyres are also more similar to the tyres used every 
                    day by ordinary motorists, which helps Pirelli to transfer Formula 
                    1 technology onto the road car product.</p>

                    <header class="sub-header">C1</header>
                    <p>This is the hardest tire in the range, which will be nominated for
                        the circuits that take the most energy out of the tires. These could
                        typically include places like Silverstone or Suzuka. It's designed
                        to provide maximum resistance to heat and extreme forces, being
                        capable of running very long stints with minimal drop-off in terms
                        of performance.

                </div>
                <div class="tire-section inside">
                    <header class="sub-header">C2</header>
                    <p>The second-hardest compound is more versatile than the C1, but it
                        sits at the harder end of the range, which makes it more suitable
                        to the faster, hotter and abrasive circuits. The harder compounds
                        are also sometimes nominated for new circuits, in order to provide
                        a conservative selection when the circumstances are still relatively
                        unknown.

                <div class="tire-section inside">
                    <header class="sub-header">C3</header>
                    <p>With three compounds nominated for each race, this one will be used
                        at every event and as such it has to be extremely versatile - as it
                        will sometimes be used as the hardest compound, sometimes as the
                        middle compound, and sometimes as the softest compound. With an
                        excellent balance between performance and versatility, this is well-
                        suited to a wide range of circumstances.

                    <header class="sub-header">C4</header>
                    <p>It's designed to work well on the tight and twisty circuits, where
                        quite a quick warm up is required in order to hit peak performance
                        immediately. This is another tire that is used extensively throughout
                        the season, making it adaptable to a number of different tracks.

                    <header class="sub-header">C5</header>
                    <p>These are the very softest tires in the redeveloped range, designed
                        for the slowest circuits with low wear and degradation where maximum
                        mechanical grip is required from the rubber. These are normally
                        seen at street circuits, most typically in Monaco, and also on
                        circuits where the asphalt is exceptionally smooth.
